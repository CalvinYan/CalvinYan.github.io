<h1>Calvin Yan</h1>
<em>Senior, L&S CS</em>

<p>Ni Howdy, I'm Calvin! Calvin with a C, since I get asked a lot. I'm a decent programmer with terrible style, which led me to take this class. Some fun facts about me: I may have cracked a rib during a skiing accident but haven't bothered to get it checked, I have a double crown, I got ratioed on my high school Facebook meme page, and my mom's nickname for me is "Watermelon King".
    At any given time, you can find me playing my electronic drum kit, doing pen spinning tricks, listening to Touhou soundtracks, or sucking at chess. </p>

<p>My three favorite places to eat at Berkeley:</p>

    <li>Berkeley Social Club</li>
    <li>Poke Parlor</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reading Responses</h2>

    <li>I learned that the default content in a search bar is often an intentional design choice. In the case of AirBnB, "Try searching 'London'" enticed the user into imagining their own travel destinations. When I searched the apps that I used, I found that some also used this technique. </li>
    <li>I thought the case studies the author used really helped to demonstrate a "design mentality". I found myself agreeing with many of her observations, and was encouraged to practice it on other designs, including the blog post itself.</li>
    <li>"You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product. Open an app you use often and resist the urge to start scrolling through content."</li>
    <li>I would rate the experience a <strong>6</strong>. I found the content informative, but short, and I wish the author applied the learning examples to her own design work.</li>
