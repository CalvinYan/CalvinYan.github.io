						<li>
							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> Because of past articles that discussed the role of scientific disciplines in UX 
								design, I'm inclined to agree with the author's argument. However, I question whether 
								he makes it convincingly. Some of the points, like the way decision making time 
								increases as choice increases, are asserted without evidence despite being intuitive. 
								Others, like the stages of information processing, seem overally generalized; I wonder 
								if users sometimes move between these phases in a non-linear fasion. </p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article and why?</p>
							<p> This experience was closer to a <strong>5.</strong> I felt the brevity and lack of 
								visual examples were a significant detriment to the article's quality. However, I found 
								the principles discussed to be interesting and well explained</p>
