                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> By looking through the designs and noting each one's strengths, I realized that there are many forms of excellence in design. Some interfaces emphasize their visual components, be it through thematic and striking color palettes, memorable typography and iconography, or creative animations. Other designs really shine in interactivity, providing intuitive, seamless, gorgeous user interfaces.</p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I enjoyed viewing and analyzing the various designs. They were unique, eye-catching, and effective. Besides, the article didn't contain anything else.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite design is the easygrow.io mobile app, which I found visually minimalistic yet also pleasing to the eye. The vibrant colors that change to complement each crop and the rounded, slim interface design help communicate the healthiness and simple joy of gardening, while data on environmental conditions is presented cleanly and clearly. Other standouts in visual presentation include Midnight Hour,
                                with its really creative use of negative space, and the Welcome Screen/Login, which got great mileage out of its animations. Meanwhile, concepts like Add to Cart, with its customizable, dynamic shoe previews, showed impressive UX design. </p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> I would rate the experience a <strong>4.</strong> While I did greatly appreciate the design samples, my enjoyment was hampered by the lack of any written content whatsoever;
                                I had hoped there would be some commentary to accentuate my understanding and appreciation of the designs, and the designs themselves felt disorganized as a result. </p>
