						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that one of the primary objectives of animation is to draw the user's
								attention while avoiding distracting it. To do this, it must make use of motion which is
								natural, so as to not feel jarring, organized, to align with the flow of content, and
								swift, to not exhaust the user's patience. An interesting detail I never considered was
								the role of size in governing animation speed. Both the size of the viewport, and of the
								content being animated, may affect the ideal animation duration.

						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The example animations that compared good and bad design really stood out to me. Without them, it would have been difficult
								to visualize certain concepts, like the effect of viewport size on animation speed. The author's very scientific approach
								to animation also resonated with me. By citing studies on human cognition, and constraining animation design to
								the laws of physics, the article justifies its points well and feels authoritative. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "So, if we sum up all of the above-mentioned rules and principles, the animation in the
								interface should reflect the movements that we know from the physical world â€” friction,
								acceleration, etc. Imitating the behavior of objects from the real world we can create a
								sequence that allows users to understand what to expect from the interface."</p>
