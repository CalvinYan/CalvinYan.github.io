						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that the Gestalt principles, which is used to describe visual pattern 	
								matching in psychology, could also inform efficient and highly communicative interface 
								design. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> It would have to be the article's organization. I thought the use of different colors 
								to separate each design concept was creative and effective. The way the author used Gestalt principles to design the header image was also highly impressive.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "As the Closure principle states, when presented with the right amount of information, our brain will jump to conclusions by filling in the gaps and creating a unified whole. This way we can decrease the number of elements needed to communicate information, reducing complexity and making designs more engaging." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I believe this article deserves an <strong>8.</strong> Enjoyable, but could have used 
								examples of real design to reinforce the principles. </p>
